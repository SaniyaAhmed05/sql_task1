# Library Management System Database
Task: Design a relational database schema and normalize it up to 3NF.

To design an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram for any domain, the following systematic approach should be followed:
* Understand the domain
* Identify entities
* Determine relationships
* Add attributes
* Normalize the data
* Review and refine

Outcome:
* ER Diagram: Visual representation of entities and relationships.

* SQL Script: Table creation scripts for the normalized schema.

* Normalization Report: Documentation of the 3NF normalization process.
